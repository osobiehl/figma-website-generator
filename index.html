</div><div class = "css-1898-209">
This is presided by the Process Team:
</div><div class = "css-1898-214">
We gather all the necessary information for a thorough assessment of your operation’s current status; this usually implies on-site visits and face-to-face meetings but can also be done virtually. Namely, we set up meetings with relevant stakeholders, explore your organization’s pain-points, read all pertinent documentation, examine your infrastructure, discuss management/development/delivery/release processes, etc. Afterward, based on our findings, we present an effective plan to achieve your company’s vendor transition objectives. This includes defining a roadmap, determining the new team’s structure, and writing up an architecture diagnosis document.
</div><div class=css-1898-213></div><div class = "css-1898-216">
This is an adaptation period where information is transferred from the old vendor to the new. Project documentation, access to source code, assets, development/production environments, and deployment/management procedures are some of the aspects involved in this stage. Generally, this is executed by the core team that participated in the discovery phase, guaranteeing continuity, and allowing accrued knowledge to be capitalized upon throughout the entire transition process.

</div><div class=css-1898-215></div><div class = "css-1898-218">
The new team, defined during discovery, takes charge of all on-going development and maintenance efforts. The core team - those who went through the knowledge transfer - ramp up the new team members based on the established roadmap, using artifacts and processes defined during stage two. This continues until dependency on the old vendor team is eliminated and the new team flies solo, taking over completely.

What does your current vendor solution lack?


</div><div class=css-1898-403></div><div class = "css-1898-212">
We’re keenly aware there may come a moment when an organization faces the need to switch vendors for their tech operation. Outsourcing is a well-established practice in the global technology market and it’s a certified way to lower costs and to maximize business. However, a point may be reached when the value provided by an outsourced vendor is not optimal - they may not be able to keep up with your need to improve/transform your operation; perhaps you’re looking to leverage better methods or processes in a shifting outsourcing market; maybe your company wants to reduce vendor costs; or, unfortunately, there has been a breach of contract. Whatever the reason, on many occasions the best way forward is a new and improved vendor solution.
 
Although the effective and tactful handling of the many variables involved in changing vendors may seem like a daunting task, it doesn’t have to be. This is where Avantica can help.
 
Be it shifting to a completely new vendor, coordinating a new management scheme, or wanting to consolidate your vendor operation, Avantica brings curated industry know-how and experience to ensure everything goes smoothly for your organization.
